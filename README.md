# Corrosion Modeling using Cellular Automata

## Overview
This project provides a Python implementation for modeling corrosion using Cellular Automata (CA). The model incorporates Fick's second law of diffusion and reaction kinetics to simulate the corrosion process in a 2D environment. The project is designed to help researchers and students understand and analyze corrosion patterns and behaviors in materials.

## Features
- **2D Cellular Automata Simulation**: Simulate corrosion in a 2D grid with adjustable parameters.
- **Fick's Second Law Implementation**: Model the diffusion process in the corrosion environment.
- **Reaction Kinetics**: Integrate reaction kinetics to simulate the interaction between corrosion agents and the material.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the corrosion process over time with graphical outputs.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the required dependencies. Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Python script to start the simulation:

```bash
python Corrosion_CA.py
```

Adjust the parameters in the script to fit your specific needs or research focus.
